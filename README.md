# Progress on the DIO platform

This repository aims to document the progress within the DIO (Digital Innovation One) platform.

This repository will store information such as:
- hours of activities performed per week;
- important links;
- a list of courses completed, in progress and planned.

It was conceived from a project challenge proposed in a DIO Bootcamp whose objective was to create a first repository on Git/Github
